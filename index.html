            <p>In many parts of Ghana, and elsewhere in West Africa, 
            a personâ€™s name is determined by the day of the week in which she/he was born.
            Enter your birthdate and gender below to read and hear your day name in Ashanti Twi, 
           a dialect of Akan and the most widely spoken language in Ghana.</p><br>
            <p>This application generates your Akan name by calculating the 
            day of the week one was born and depending on one's gender it outputs the Akan name.
            </p>
